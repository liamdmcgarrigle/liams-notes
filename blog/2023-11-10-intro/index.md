### Who am I
Hi there, My name is Liam. A bit about me:
- I have a very time-consuming and stressful full-time job
- I have a side project addiction (that is not limited to tech)
- I can never decide what to learn so I try to learn everything

### Why I am Starting This
With all of that, organizing my thoughts and knowledge is really important to my day-to-day life. 
I've found that the best way for me to learn and retain information is to make tutorials and documentation for myself. Not only does it help me learn, but then I can go back and reference what I made. 

Before this site, I would make big Google Drive folders full of documents. If I do a small/medium project I document as I go and end up with huge unorganized Google Docs. It is always worth the time because I often go back to see how I solved problems and copy code, making the next projects easier, but it is pretty hard to navigate.

So the long and short of it is that I am making this site a much better version of what I currently do on Google Drive, which is proven to help me stay focused and motivated. Even this blog post, I am just writing it for myself. 

If you are reading this and are not me, HI! Shoot me an email. Let's chat. Pretty cool that you're here.

### My Plans For This
#### General Plans
I want to make the knowledge base on this site modular and organized. I want to add content every time I work on a project or learn something worth remembering. While it will take a very long time, I want this to be so full of content and knowledge that maybe it would be valuable to others.
#### Specific Plans
The "docs" will be information on specifics. The "blogs" will be general (but still well organized) how-tos, tutorials, and small projects. The write-ups will link back to the more general docs for specifics.

### What This Is Not
This is not official docs or a source of truth. I make a lot of mistakes. Tons of spelling mistakes, but many other types as well. I am not intending to host courses or reinvent documentation, just to organize my process through learning new skills.
