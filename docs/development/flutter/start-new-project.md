title: Start New Project
---

Once you have Flutter installed and set up on your system, starting a Flutter project is simple. 

In a terminal, once you have `cd`ed to the desired directory, use the `flutter create` command like below:
```bash
flutter create project-name
```

It is usually best practice to add parameters to the project from the create command. Depending on the project different params may be required. To see a list of all of the parameters run `flutter create --help` in the terminal.
