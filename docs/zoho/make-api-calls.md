# Here is how you make API calls in Zoho custom functions

:::warning[This only works in the deluge editors]

Some code editors in Zoho let you use JavaScript, such as client script editor. This does not work in those cases.

```jsx title="/src/components/HelloCodeTitle.js"
function heresSomeCode(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, deluge script sucks</h1>;
}
```
