You write custom functions in Zoho with Deluge script. The functions can be called from throughout the Zoho ecosystem allowing for flexible customization.

I will try to record some different use cases. I am not sure how this folder will be, I will likely put stuff in here without organization until I need to add some folders, at which point I will probably have a better idea of what will actually be here.
