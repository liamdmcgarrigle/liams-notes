I will not be showing how things are done from scratch. Basic coding principles will be required to understand most things

Deluge is Zoho's scripting language used in its apps for automation, filters, API calls, custom spreadsheet functions, and more. In theory, Deluge sounds amazing, a simple scripting language built around the Zoho ecosystem. 

In practice, in my experience, Deluge leaves a lot to be desired.
- The Deluge editor SDK is buggy and lacks features
- Deluge itself can be buggy
- The simplicity ends up hurting reliability once you want to do more complex tasks
- Docs are incomplete and limited users since it is only for Zoho


I would have preferred Zoho to use something established like [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and build their own [SDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) to create the ease of use they want.

We will never get that, and let's face it, Deluge is better than nothing. Far better. So Let's learn how to make some tasty lemonade and hope things like the buggy code editor get better with time.
