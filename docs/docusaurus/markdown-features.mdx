## Code 

:::tip[There are many more features to the code blocks!]

Docusaurus has built-in TONS of really cool code block features. Check them out [here](/docs/docusaurus/code-block-features).

:::

Here is some inline code `var = "hi I'm some code";` text can go after too.
```markdown

## Dropdown (Details) 

:::warning[This requires MDX]

When creating your file, ensure it has the `.mdx` ending

:::

:::warning[This Can Be Buggy]

In my experience the details tags are buggy. Ensure is it formatted exactly as shown below including spaces and line breaks.

:::

<details>
  <summary>You can put a title here</summary>

    You can put any content you want in here!

</details>

```md
<details>

## Tabs

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Apple" default>
    This is an apple üçé
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Orange">
    This is an orange üçä
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana" label="Banana">
    This is a banana üçå
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

````md
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
<!-- Ensure the inputs are under the front matter but over the rest of the content -->

<Tabs>

## Mermaid Charts

:::warning[This requires imports]

                <details>
                                        <summary>Import and Configuration Instructions</summary>

Install the plugin using the terminal
```
npm install --save @docusaurus/theme-mermaid
```

configure plugin in `docusaurus.config.ts` file
```js title="docusaurus.config.ts"
...
i18n: {
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    locales: ['en'],
  },

// highlight-start
  markdown: {
    mermaid: true,
  },
  themes: ['@docusaurus/theme-mermaid'],
// highlight-end

  presets:
...
```
The highlighted code above shows the configuration I used in the `docusaurus.config.ts` file. Docusaurus does this differently. It did not work for me, but you can find that [here](:::warning[This requires MDX]

When creating your file, ensure it has the `.mdx` ending

:::).

## Get Any Look You Want

The amazing thing is that Docusaurus is completely open source, as are most of the sites that use Docusaurus!

This page right here is open source! If you click the "edit this page" button at the bottom of the page it will take you right to the source code! Most websites made with Docusaurus have this, including Docusaurus themselves. 

That means that if you see something you are trying to do on another Docusaurus build website, you can look at the code to see exactly how it was done.

There is a list of sites built with Docusaurus [here](https://docusaurus.io/showcase)!
