## Starting New Docs Site

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

CD into the desired directory and run this command.
Replace "my-website" with your project name

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Run your site

Ensure you're terminal is in the correct directory. Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run start
```

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

## Deploy your site
