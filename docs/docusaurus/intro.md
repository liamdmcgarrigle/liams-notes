description: An introduction to what Docusarous is and why I made my own docs.

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';

Docusaurus is an [open-source](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) static site generator for making documentation and blog websites made by Facebook. 

The big question is...why am I making my own documentation for a documentation framework that has [amazing documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) itself?

There are two reasons:
1. This is my preferred way of taking notes
2. I learn things much better when I am in the mindset of teaching/documenting it for others

I touched on this in my [welcome blog post](/blog), which explains what this site is and what it's for. Check that out!
