## Example of Styled Code Block

```js showLineNumbers title="thing.js"
{
  className: 'theme-code-block-highlighted-line',
  line: 'highlight-next-line',
  block: { start: 'highlight-start', end: 'highlight-end' },
},
//highlight-start
{
  className: 'code-block-added-line',
  line: 'Next Line Added',
},
//highlight-end
{
  className: 'code-block-sub-line',
  line: 'Next Line Subbed',
},
```
````md
```js showLineNumbers title="thing.js"
{
  className: 'theme-code-block-highlighted-line',
  line: 'highlight-next-line',
  block: { start: 'highlight-start', end: 'highlight-end' },
},
//highlight-start
{
  className: 'code-block-added-line',
  line: 'Next Line Added',
},
//highlight-end
{
  className: 'code-block-sub-line',
  line: 'Next Line Subbed',
},
```
````


Here is an example showing a change
```js 
{
  className: 'code-block-sub-line',
//Next Line Subbed
- line: 'Next Line Subbed',
//Next Line Added
+ line: 'Next Line Subtracted', //added a better name
},
```

````md
```js 
{
  className: 'code-block-sub-line',
  //Next Line Subbed
  line: 'Next Line Subbed',
  //Next Line Added
  line: 'Next Line Subtracted', //added a better name
},
```
````

:::warning

Avoid using the diff styling with line numbers. This is because when differences are shown the line numbers would be the same. For example, in this code, lines 2 and 3 should both be labeled as line 2.

```js showLineNumbers
thing 1
//Next Line Subbed
thing 3
//Next Line Added
thing 2
thing 3
```

### Set Up Custom Highlighting
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docusaurus.config.js">


  ```js
  export default {
    themeConfig: {
      prism: {
        magicComments: [
          // Remember to extend the default highlight class name as well!
          {
            className: 'theme-code-block-highlighted-line',
            line: 'highlight-next-line',
            block: {start: 'highlight-start', end: 'highlight-end'},
          },
          // highlight-start
          {
            className: 'code-block-added-line',
            line: 'Next Line Added',
          },
          {
            className: 'code-block-sub-line',
            line: 'Next Line Subbed',
          },
          // highlight-end
        ],
      },
    },
  };
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="src/css/custom.css">

  ```css
  .code-block-added-line {
    background-color: #14BE01;
    display: block;
    margin: 0 calc(-1 * var(--ifm-pre-padding));
    padding: 0 var(--ifm-pre-padding);
    border-left: 3px solid #ff000080;
  }

  .code-block-sub-line {
    background-color: #ff000020;
    display: block;
    margin: 0 calc(-1 * var(--ifm-pre-padding));
    padding: 0 var(--ifm-pre-padding);
    border-left: 3px solid #ff000080;
  }
  ```


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="myDoc.md">

  ````md
  Now we can show which lines being added and subtracted

  ```js
  const name = null;
  // Next Line Subbed
  - console.log(name.toUpperCase());
  // Next-Line-Added
  + console.log(name.toLowerCase());
  // we changed from upper case to lower case
  ```
  ````
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
 ```js showLineNumbers 
  const name = null;
  // Next Line Subbed
  - console.log(name.toUpperCase());
  // Next Line Added
  + console.log(name.toLowerCase());
  // we changed from upper case to lower case
  ```

## Line Numbers

```js showLineNumbers
this is code
this is code too
this is code also
this is code
```

````md
```js showLineNumbers
this is code
this is code too
this is code also
this is code
```
````


## Code Titles
```md title="/src/components/HelloCodeTitle.js"
this is code
this is code too
this is code also
```
````md
```md title="/src/components/HelloCodeTitle.js"
this is code
this is code too
this is code also
```
````


## Difference Highlighting
````diff
- ```jsx {3}
+ ```jsx {4}
  function HighlightSomeText(highlight) {
    if (highlight) {
+     console.log('Highlighted text found');
      return 'This text is highlighted!';
    }

    return 'Nothing highlighted';
  }
  ```
